#XYZ HOTEL


A hotel description typically highlights key features of the property, including its location, amenities, room types, and services. It may also mention any unique aspects like views, nearby attractions, or special offers. The goal is to give potential guests an overview of what to expect and why the hotel would be a great choice for their stay.
